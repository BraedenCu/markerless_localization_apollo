APOLLO Lab Project Pipeline: Next Steps 
Steps
    - Familiarize yourself with foundation pose, try to get Ryan demo working on my linux machine or the laptop in the lab
    - Complete the migration between foundation pose and Danny’s spatial computing python library (APOLLO toolbox library)
        - Migrate foundation pose to fit Danny’s library version
            - To get a basic version (remove the install apollo-toolbox-py (# Install Apollo-tool-py), and under # installl miniconda change to 3.8
        - We want a setup process so that we can get these working in any python version that the APOLLO version is compatible with
        - Foundation pose is in 3.8 —> needs to work with future versions of python to ensure compatibility with the APOLLO toolkit

Course of action
    1. Get Ryans demo working on the laptop (foundation pose demo)
    2. Revert miniconda environment initialization settings, begin debugging the conflict issues with the differing versions of python compatibility
